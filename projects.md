### Dynamics of Morphogenesis
  The century-old seminal work of D'Arcy Thompson, On Growth and Form, gave a new dimension to studying growth using mathematical and physical principles to propose mechanisms by which organisms acquire their shapes and sizes. Inspired by this work and more recent developments in the field, we posed the problem of studying how growth factors and surface topology interact during growth. The basic idea is to model this as a process with two parts : 
  --  The concentration of growth factors determine stress fields which modify the surface topology. 
  -- This change in topology destabilizes the equilibrium concentration field of growth factors and chemical diffusion defines the new concentration field.
  I used [Surface Evolver](https://facstaff.susqu.edu/brakke/evolver/evolver.html) and [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) to computationally implement the surface mechanics and diffusion respectively.

### Avascular Tumor Growth
  For my course project of Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, I studied the different mathematical approaches that are used to model cancer growth specifically growth of avascular tumor. This choice of project was motivated by the *The Emperor of All Maladies* which was a brilliant read.
