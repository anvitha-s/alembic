I am a senior undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) majoring in Mechanical Engineering with honors. My main research interests are in the field of soft matter and mechanobiology. Currently I am working on the mechanics and dynamics of morphogenesis for my undergraduate thesis.
