I am a senior undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) majoring in Mechanical Engineering with honors. My main research interests are in the field of soft matter and mechanobiology. Currently I am working on the mechanics and dynamics of morphogenesis for my undergraduate thesis.

I like to play around with code, read fiction and comics, and debate the phiosophy of life in my free time. More recently my reading list that was predominantly psychological thrillers has been taken over by behavioural economics and biology. 

I do enjoy discussing books, though not as much as reading them, and I look forward to talk about my most exciting reads this month :
- Why I write, George Orwell
- The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health, and Disease, Daniel E. Lieberman
- They Both Die at the End, Adam Silvera
